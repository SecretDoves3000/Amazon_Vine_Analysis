# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview
This analysis looks at user review data taken from Amazon's review database. This analysis looks at reviews of musical instrument purchases. We are looking to see if there is any bias in review scores for Amazon's paid review program called "vine"

## Results

- From our analysis we see that the total number of vine reviews was 59 far outnumbered by the non-vine reviews numbering at 13480
- Amongst the vine reviews there were 34 five star reviews, and amongst non-vine reviews there were 7678 five star reviews
- Somewhat suprisingly, this gives roughly equal percentages of five star reviews, with ~57.6% five star reviews for vine reviews and ~57.0% five star reviews for non-vine reviews

## Summary
We conclued initially that there is little positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program, although there are some issues to consider. One, the vine program is incredibly small, so the analysis may not be stable over time. Two, this data only pulls from musical instrument reviews; for a full analysis we should examine a number of product types. Three, this analysis only considers the percentage of five star reviews, not the overall review distribution. We recommend that these distributions be plotted and analyzed in more detail to give a clearer picture of any biases produced by the vine program.
